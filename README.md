# 🦉 Docuowl

Docuowl generates a static single-page documentation from Markdown files

## Rationale
As a long-time fan of documentation style made by [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/api),
and Markdown, I decided to use the former to create a pretty documentation generator
that outputs something like Stripe's. Stripe also generously allowed me to use their
layout, so here's a big thank you to them! ♥️

## Documentation Organization
Docuowl takes a directory as input. The directory is expected to have one 
directory for each section or group. Each group may have subsections, which by 
their turn must also be placed into directories.
Each **Section** is required to have an `content.md` file, containing the 
Frontmatter for that section, and an optional `sidenotes.md` file, that will be
rendered to the right of the section. The Frontmatter must contain at least a
`Title` property, and an optional `ID` property containing a unique slug for that
section.
Each **Group** must contain a single `meta.md` file, containing a Frontmatter like
a Section, and an optional content following the frontmatter.

For instance, take the following directory tree as example:

```
.
├── 1-introduction
│   └── content.md
├── 2-errors
│   ├── content.md
│   └── sidenotes.md
├── 3-authentication
│   ├── content.md
│   └── sidenotes.md
├── 4-authorization
│   ├── 1-login
│   │   ├── content.md
│   │   └── sidenotes.md
│   ├── 2-logout
│   │   ├── content.md
│   │   └── sidenotes.md
│   ├── 4-me
│   │   ├── content.md
│   │   └── sidenotes.md
│   └── meta.md
├── 5-foo
│   ├── 1-listing-foos
│   │   ├── content.md
│   │   └── sidenotes.md
│   ├── 2-merged-foos
│   │   ├── content.md
│   │   └── sidenotes.md
│   └── meta.md
├── 6-bars
│   ├── content.md
│   └── sidenotes.md
├── 7-list-foobars
│   ├── content.md
│   └── sidenotes.md
├── 8-get-foobar
│   ├── content.md
│   └── sidenotes.md
└── 9-foobar-data
    ├── content.md
    └── sidenotes.md
```

### Example of `meta.md`:

```markdown
---
Title: Authorization
---

> :warning: **Warning**: All authorization endpoints are currently in maintenance
```

### Markdown Extensions

Docuowl introduces two new blocks to Markdown: Boxes and Attributes List.

#### Boxes
Boxes can only be used in sidenotes. To create a new box, use the following
format:

```
#! This is a box
And this is the box's content
```

After one `#!`, the box will take any content that follows until one of the 
following conditions are met:

1. A horizontal ruler is found (`----`)
2. Another Box begins.

#### Attributes List
Attributes Lists can only be used in contents. To create a new Attribute List,
use the following format:

```
#- Attribute List
- Key1 `type`
- Key1 Description
```

## Usage
Docuowl can be invoked in two modes: Compile, and Watch.

### Compile
Compilation will output a single `index.html` file to an specified directory, 
taking another directory as input. For instance:

```bash
$ docuowl --input docs --output docs-html
```

### Watch
Watch allows one to continuously write documentation and see the preview with
auto-reload. For that, use:

```bash
$ docuowl --input docs --output docs-html --watch

Docuowl v0.1
Listening on 127.0.0.1:8000
```

Then open your browser and point to 127.0.0.1:8000. The page will be reloaded 
each time a file changes in the `input` directory.
